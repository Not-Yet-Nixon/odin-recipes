    <h2>Lumpia Recipe Description</h2>  
    <p>
        Lumpia is a popular Filipino snack consisting of savory 
        spring rolls filled with a mixture of ground meat, vegetables,
         and seasonings, all wrapped in a thin pastry. The rolls are 
         typically deep-fried to a golden crisp, making them a 
         delicious and crunchy appetizer or side dish.
    </p>
    <p>
        Lumpia can be enjoyed with a dipping sauce, often sweet chili 
        or soy-vinegar, enhancing its flavorful filling. Versatile 
        and easy to prepare, lumpia is a staple at Filipino gatherings
        and can be adapted with different fillings, from traditional 
        pork to vegetarian options.
